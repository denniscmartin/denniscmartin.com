Lazybear is my first iOS app and programming project. It was a stock tracker. You could save your favourite stocks, check their current price and the main financial ratios. Also you cold see a historical chart of the stock. I've built
the backend API in Python using Flask and store the data in a mysql database. It was a nice project and I learnt a lot.

As a side note, I managed to actually publish the app to the App Store (it's no longer published). It was awesome to see y
our first app in the App Store.
