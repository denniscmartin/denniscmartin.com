A command line utility to calculate the theoretical call and put price of an European option using the black-scholes method.

Code: <https://github.com/denniscmartin/python-black-scholes>

Previously, the project name was `fucking-black-scholes`, but I changed it to make sure that no employer thinks Iâ€™m crazy or something.

# Usage

```bash
fbs --help
```

# Example

Price an European call option with the following data:

- Spot price -> $20

- Exercise price -> $21

- Risk free rate -> 5%

- Standard deviation -> 25%

- Time to expiration -> 6 months

```bash
fbs \
--spot-price=20.00 \
--exercise-price=21.00 \
--risk-free-rate=0.05 \
--std=0.25 \
--expiration=0.5
```

```bash
---------------------------------------------
European call option price: 1.197698084193286
---------------------------------------------
European put option price: 1.6792062367882679
---------------------------------------------
```
