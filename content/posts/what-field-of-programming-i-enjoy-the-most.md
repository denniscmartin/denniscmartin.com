After almost 4 years learning programming, I’ve not discovered yet what field I enjoy the most. However, I know what I want to experience while programming.

I want to solve real problems. I’m not a `${INSERT_ANY_LANGUAGE_HERE}` developer, I’m not a web developer, I’m not a game developer, I’m not a `${INSERT_FRAMEWORK_HERE}` developer, I’m not a full-stack full-level super-dope full-beard full-chad web network ios django angular react enterprise developer.

I’m a programmer. I solve problems with code. I don’t care if is a problem in the health or finance industry. I don’t care if it’s a game or a mobile app. Just tell me the problem and I’ll try to solve it using my tools.
