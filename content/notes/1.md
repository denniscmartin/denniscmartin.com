This is my last (I hope) attempt to start a blog. I’m committed to stop deleting
everything and starting over every time I’m bored.

## This is my new site

Back in 2019 I started learning programming, so I decided to start a blog. It seemed like
a good idea. A place to host all of my projects, to post blogs about what I’ve been
learning and to share my ideas on anything that I find interesting. And
that’s what I did.

However, I’ve always been the kind of guy that deletes everything and start over from
scratch when I don’t like something, instead of improving what I already have. So that’s
what I’ve been doing since then. I started a few blogs and deleted all of then. This is
my final blog, I promise.
